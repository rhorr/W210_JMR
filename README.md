### W210_JMR

#### Welcome to the Repo of Pet Buddy: Adoption Predictor from W210, Sec 09, Summer 2025. Our aim is to improve the likelihood of adoption for pets by prioritizing shelter worker efforts in high volume shelters. This is done through predicting likely reasons an animal my not be adopted, surfacing the main drivers for that animal for intervention, and if likely to not be adopted, diverting them to a team to help find their owner, a foster or a rescue.

#### We've included several key files here, covering our output Source data from harmonization, Data Preprocessing, our Machine Learning Training and Validation, Build of our Infrastructure in AWS (Lambda/Endpoints) and code for our Streamlit Dashboards.

#### Thanks for your interest in our project!
